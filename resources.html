      <h2>Quick questions to ask before you apply</h2>
      <p class="small">
        These questions target the most common “surprise costs” and hidden requirements. If a leasing office can’t answer clearly,
        request the information in writing.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>What is the total estimated move-in cost for this unit?</strong> (Ask for itemized breakdown.)</li>
        <li><strong>What fees are required monthly?</strong> (Trash, pest, package, parking, tech, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Which utilities are included and which are tenant-paid?</strong> (Ask for typical monthly ranges.)</li>
        <li><strong>What are your minimum screening requirements?</strong> (Income multiple, credit expectations, background rules.)</li>
        <li><strong>What is the approval timeline?</strong> (How long screening takes; how long the unit is held.)</li>
        <li><strong>Do you require renter’s insurance?</strong> (Minimum coverage; provider requirements.)</li>
        <li><strong>What is your deposit policy?</strong> (How deposit is calculated; refund terms.)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Paying an application fee without clear requirements is risky.
        Transparency should come before payment.

      <h2>Mini glossary (plain-language definitions)</h2>
      <p class="small">

      <h2>Trusted renter resources (starting points)</h2>
      <p class="small">
        These are general resources that explain common renter rights, leasing terms, and questions to ask.
        Always verify local laws and policies for your city/state.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development):</strong> general renter guidance and housing information.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):</strong> consumer protection resources and financial guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Local tenant resource centers / legal aid:</strong> city/state-level renter rights and dispute support.</li>
        <li><strong>University off-campus housing office:</strong> student-specific leasing tips and vetted listings (when available).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Save screenshots or written quotes of fees/requirements before paying any application fee.
        Documentation reduces “he said/she said” later.
