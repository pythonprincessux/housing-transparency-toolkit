      <h2>Why accessibility matters in housing information</h2>
      <p>
        Housing decisions are high-stakes: renters may spend application fees, commit to leases, or miss deadlines based on the
        information provided (or not provided). When listings are hard to navigate, written in unclear language, or inconsistent
        across pages, it increases decision errors—especially for first-time renters, students, and people using assistive technology.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <strong>Design goal:</strong> improve clarity and navigation so that more users can reliably find the same information,
        compare options fairly, and avoid preventable financial harm.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Accessibility features implemented (what this site does)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Semantic page structure:</strong> headings follow a clear hierarchy (one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> per page, then <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> sections).</li>
        <li><strong>Landmarks:</strong> consistent <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> regions to support screen-reader navigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Skip link:</strong> keyboard users can jump directly to main content.</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard navigation support:</strong> all links and interactive elements are usable without a mouse.</li>
        <li><strong>Visible focus states:</strong> <code>:focus-visible</code> styling makes it clear where the keyboard is on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptive navigation:</strong> links use meaningful text (e.g., “Platform Comparison” instead of “Click here”).</li>
        <li><strong>Readable layout:</strong> consistent spacing, line-height, and content width to reduce visual fatigue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Note: If images are added (e.g., screenshots for evidence), they should include descriptive <code>alt</code> text that explains what the user should learn from the image.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Plain-language design decisions (clarity over jargon)</h2>
      <p>
        Housing listings often use terms that assume experience (e.g., “prorated,” “admin fee,” “screening criteria,” “holding fee”).
        This site uses plain-language best practices to reduce confusion and help users compare information consistently.

      <h2>How this supports housing transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility and plain language are not “nice extras.” They change who can access information and how reliably people can use it.
        When cost and eligibility details are easier to find, renters can compare options earlier, ask better questions, and avoid
        wasting application fees on listings that do not meet their constraints.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        In short: clearer information design improves decision quality.
