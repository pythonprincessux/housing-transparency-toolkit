      <h2>Method: Transparency Rubric (0–3 scale)</h2>
      <p>
        This evaluation applies a rubric-based heuristic review to compare listing transparency across platforms.
        Each category is scored using a 0–3 scale:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0</strong> = Not disclosed or very difficult to find</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> = Mentioned but incomplete or unclear</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> = Mostly disclosed with minor gaps</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> = Clearly disclosed, upfront, and easy to locate</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Listings were reviewed for visibility of fees, requirements, monthly cost clarity, and plain-language readability.

      <h2>Findings</h2>

      <h3>Zillow</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Base rent is typically visible and searchable.</li>
        <li>Required monthly add-on fees are often missing or buried.</li>
        <li>Move-in cost breakdown is rarely presented upfront.</li>
        <li>Eligibility criteria are inconsistently disclosed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Apartments.com</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Listing completeness (photos, floor plans, amenities) is generally stronger.</li>
        <li>Utility information is more likely to be included but may lack cost estimates.</li>
        <li>Move-in fees and screening requirements remain inconsistent.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Design Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Require standardized “Total Monthly Cost” summaries before application submission.</li>
        <li>Display a mandatory move-in cost breakdown table for every listing.</li>
        <li>Include clearly labeled eligibility requirements (income multiple, credit range, co-signer policy).</li>
        <li>Add plain-language definitions for key terms (admin fee, holding fee, prorated rent).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Standardizing fee disclosure reduces preventable financial harm and improves renter decision reliability.

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        This evaluation reflects a sample review of listings rather than a full platform audit.
        Disclosure practices may vary by property management company and region.
